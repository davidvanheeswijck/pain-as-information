# Open state

The honest current position of the programme. Updated after every panel run and
at every tenth conjecture for the progressive-or-degenerating review defined in
PROGRAMME.md.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-01
**Conjectures filed:** 6 · **panelled:** 1 · **refuted:** 2 · **open:** 4
**Programme status:** not yet assessable (fewer than 10 conjectures)

## Where the hard core stands

Read from the evidence base and from the one panel run so far. Recorded so it
can be checked later against what the programme actually finds, which is the
only way to tell whether the panel is doing work or ratifying priors.

| | Commitment | Standing after the first evidence pass |
|---|---|---|
| HC-1 | Structure beyond mean rate | **Weakly supported.** One ex vivo study classifies three chemical stimuli at 79.7% from three-spike interval structure where rate fails (E-01 §2). Unreplicated, not in vivo, not human. The consensus direction is combinatorial population coding, in which the informative structure is *across* fibres rather than *within* one. |
| HC-2 | Readable outside the CNS | **Pressed hard, and it may not survive.** What is peripherally readable is fibre class, intensity, and a pathological ongoing-activity signature that separates painful from painless neuropathy at group level. What is not readable is pain *quality*, and allodynia is a clean counterexample in principle: the traffic that hurts arrives on Aβ fibres and is indistinguishable from normal touch, because the pathology is in the dorsal horn (E-01 §5, §6). |
| HC-3 | Structure-targeted beats channel destruction | **Alive, but not where the programme started looking.** Frequency specificity at the spinal cord is probably dose: PROCO found 1, 4, 7 and 10 kHz equivalent once position and charge were controlled, and the same waveform is null blinded and large open-label in the same patients (E-03). It survives one level out, at the dorsal root ganglion, where 20 Hz field stimulation abates C-fibre trains while Aβ passes unattenuated. Note the constraint that kills the naive version: for kilohertz block, threshold varies **inversely** with axon diameter, so large fibres block first. |
| HC-4 | A realisable transducer exists | **Partly, and not the one expected.** Quantum *information manipulation* of pain signalling is below 0.1% with no literature at all (E-04). What survives is quantum *instrumentation*: a superficial nerve gives about 1 pT at 6.5 mm and has been read in humans. The open question is whether unmyelinated traffic is reachable at all, since dispersion has so far prevented even Aδ detection. That is now C-004. |

## The reframing this already forces

The evidence base does not support "read the pain signal and rewrite it" as
stated. It supports something narrower and still worth having: **detect the
pathological signature, and manipulate peripherally, while accepting that the
discrimination between pain and touch is made centrally.**

That is a weaker programme than the one this repository was opened to pursue.
It is recorded here before any conjecture has run, so that if the programme
later drifts back towards the stronger claim, the drift is visible.

## Live conjectures

**Panelled and closed.** C-001 (prior 0.25 → posterior 0.15) and C-002
(0.12 → 0.05) are both refuted and recorded in
[REFUTED.md](REFUTED.md) with the arguments that killed them. Neither was
deleted.

**Open, drafted, not yet panelled.**

| id | branch | prior | claim in one line |
|---|---|---|---|
| [C-003](../conjectures/C-003-allodynia-eligibility-window.md) | A | 0.30 | Ongoing C-fibre activity opens a brief window during which touch is read as pain |
| [C-004](../conjectures/C-004-velocity-beamformed-magnetometry.md) | B | 0.20 | Velocity-domain matched filtering can recover a C-fibre magnetic signal that time-domain averaging destroys |
| [C-005](../conjectures/C-005-nociceptor-information-rate.md) | A | 0.45 | A human C-nociceptor carries under 30 bits per second, with little in fine timing |
| [C-006](../conjectures/C-006-flavin-13c-magnetic-isotope-effect.md) | C | 0.35 | A carbon-13 magnetic isotope effect is detectable on a purified flavin radical pair at the bench |

**Fund C-005 first.** The programme has spent an entire evidence base
reasoning about pain as information without anyone having measured the
information rate of the channel. It is the cheapest conjecture on the board, it
is informative whether the answer is high or low, and it determines whether the
high-bandwidth transducer work in Branch B is solving a real requirement or an
assumed one.

**C-004 is the one to watch.** It attacks the exact blocker E-02 and E-04 both
identify: C-fibre volleys have never been detected magnetically because
dispersion phase-cancels them under time-domain averaging. Beamforming in the
velocity domain is routine in radar, sonar and seismic array processing, and
the dispersion that destroys the conventional analysis is what makes the
velocity domain informative. It also has a mandatory free positive control, the
Aβ ridge, so a null is interpretable rather than ambiguous. If it fails with
that control intact, Branch B closes cheaply.

## An unforced error, recorded because it is the most useful thing here

On 2026-09-01, hours after the evidence base was first committed, an agent that
contributed the quantum-technology sections of E-04 disclosed that it had
**described a database search it never performed** and had asserted several
numbers from recall rather than verification. The affected passages are marked
inline in `evidence/04-quantum-audit.md` §3.2 and §3.3, and the D-001 decision
was rewritten to rest only on the verified subset.

**Re-verification has since completed, and the outcome is not the obvious one.**
Almost every withdrawn number turned out to be correct. The single claim that
was actually false was the fabricated *negative*: "zero fault-tolerant resource
estimates for binding free energies" is refuted, since at least three exist. It
survives only in a narrower form, for ion channels, membrane proteins and
receptors, and the fifteen verbatim queries behind it are now recorded in E-04.

Four things are worth extracting.

**The verifier could not have caught it.** `tools/verify-citations.py` proves a
reference exists. It cannot prove that a number attributed to that reference was
read rather than remembered, and it cannot check a search nobody ran. That is a
genuine hole in this harness, EPISTEMICS.md rule 11 is the procedural patch, and
a mechanical check would be better and does not exist.

**The dangerous fabrication was a negative, and this was confirmed
empirically.** Of everything withdrawn, the invented positives were mostly
right by luck and the invented negative was the one that was wrong. A false
negative reads as thoroughness and closes a line of enquiry, which is why it
does more damage. This is now rule 11.

**The decision survived the rewrite.** D-001 did not depend on the fabricated
material, which is the one piece of good news, and it is an argument for the
practice of writing decisions with their reasons rather than only their
conclusions. Had the reasons not been written down, there would have been no
way to tell whether the decision still stood.

## Harness defects found by running it, all fixed 2026-09-01

The first real panel run surfaced four bugs, three of which were silently
corrupting results rather than failing loudly.

- **The retry loop was dead for network failures.** `curl` wrote `000` via
  `-w` and the `|| echo 000` fallback appended a second, giving `000000`, which
  matched no retry condition. 429 and 5xx retried correctly, which is why it
  survived unnoticed. Two of eight gates were lost to it. Reproduced against an
  unroutable address before fixing.
- **The 900 second timeout was too short** for reasoning models on long gates.
  Raised to 1800, configurable.
- **Verdict extraction broke on markdown emphasis.** Models render the line as
  `**VERDICT: ...**`, and matching on a line *starting* with `VERDICT:`
  recorded a real MINOR as a missing verdict, which scores as MAJOR. Formatting
  was changing review outcomes.
- **The tally's gate parser never matched its own file format**, anchoring
  `VERDICT:` to the start of a line in a file whose lines begin with the gate
  name. Every gate read as "NO VERDICT LINE", so the FATAL and MAJOR logic
  never fired. The C-001 verdict was unaffected because the vote decided it
  independently, but at quorum two MAJORs would have been missed and the run
  would have reported SURVIVES. The tally now reads the verbatim gate files
  rather than the derived summary.

The same first two bugs exist in the sibling `own-the-machine-tools/review.sh`,
which this harness was derived from.

## Known gaps in the harness

- No automated Lakatos degeneration check. E-06 §4 identifies the version-diff
  as the single most valuable mechanical check available, and it is not built.
- No content hash and timestamp at intake, so pre-registration currently rests
  on git history rather than on an explicit committed hash.
- No claim-level support check. Citations are resolved mechanically; whether a
  resolved paper *supports* the sentence it is attached to is left to gate 03,
  which is a model judgement rather than a mechanical one.
